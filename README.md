# CodeAlpha_BasicNetworkSniffer
1️⃣ What is a Network Sniffer?

A Network Sniffer is a tool or program that monitors network traffic passing through a computer or network interface.
It “sniffs” packets — the smallest units of data transmitted across networks — to analyze their content and behavior.

Key purposes:

Understand how data flows between devices

Analyze protocols like TCP, UDP, HTTP, and ARP

Detect suspicious or unexpected network activity

Learn packet structure and network communication

2️⃣ Why Build a Network Sniffer?

Educational Purpose: Helps interns understand real-world network traffic.

Cybersecurity Awareness: Learn how attackers might monitor network traffic.

Practical Skills: Gain hands-on experience with Python, Scapy, and packet analysis.

Preparation for Advanced Tools: Foundation for tools like Wireshark, tcpdump, or IDS systems.

3️⃣ How Does It Work?

Packet Capture:
The sniffer listens to network interfaces using libraries like Scapy in Python.
Every packet sent or received by your machine is captured.

Packet Analysis:

Extract source IP, destination IP, protocol, and payload

Identify packet type (TCP, UDP, ARP, HTTP)

Optional: decode payload into human-readable text

Packet Filtering:
Users can specify filters to capture only specific types of traffic:

TCP: Transmission Control Protocol packets

UDP: User Datagram Protocol packets

HTTP: Web requests (TCP port 80)

None: Capture all packets

Saving Packets:
Captured packets are stored in a .pcap file for offline analysis using Wireshark.

4️⃣ Key Concepts Behind the Project
a) Packet Structure

Each network packet contains:

Header: Metadata about the packet (IP addresses, ports, protocol, etc.)

Payload: The actual data being sent

Example:

TCP packet → header + TCP payload

UDP packet → header + UDP payload

ARP packet → who-has / is-at messages for IP resolution

b) Protocols

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Reliable, connection-oriented protocol

UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Fast, connectionless protocol

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol): Maps IP addresses to MAC addresses in LAN

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): Web traffic over TCP port 80

c) Tools & Libraries

Python 3: Programming language used

Scapy: Python library for capturing, manipulating, and analyzing network packets

Wireshark: Visual tool to analyze .pcap files

d) Ethical Considerations

Only sniff traffic on networks you own or have permission to use

Capturing traffic on public networks without consent is illegal

This project is for learning purposes only

5️⃣ Learning Outcomes
